About
=====

db-backup handles database backups. When executed, it performs a full
database snapshot backup, timestamps it, and ships it off to an off-site
FTP server.

It also manages how many backup snapshots would you like to keep by
deleting the oldest backups on the FTP server.

It keeps logging information in /var/log/db-backup and on /dev/stdout
for each execution.

Usage
=====
Configure it by specifying the following BASH variables in the file
located at /etc/db-backup:

BACKUP_COMMAND
This should take a full snapshot backup of the database and write it
to STDOUT. db-backup will handle compressing that snapshot data
inernally, so the command should not perform any extra compression
on the snapshot data.

FTP_HOST
The CIDR address of the FTP server

FTP_USER
The username for accessing the FTP server

FTP_PASSPHRASE
The passphrase for accessing the FTP server

FTP_PATH_PREFIX
The path prefix on the FTP server in which to store the database backups

KEEP_NEWEST
The number of newest backup snapshots to keep on the FTP host
